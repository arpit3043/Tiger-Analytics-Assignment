### To create a drag and drop Report Builder.
The report builder will be a single page application.
- The user will have a side panel where he will have UI component blocks which he can drag into the canvas.
- Some of the UI Components can be - Table, Title , Line chart and Bar chart.
- Once the user drags and organizes this in a grid he should be able to store the state of the component in an Object which should help rehydrate the config through the component at a later session.
- State object could be preserved locally in memory or as a json to retrieve already created reports.
- Should demo the creation process and recreation of the dashboard.
